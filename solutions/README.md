## Solution submission

- Create a new directory with your name/ user name under the solutions directory.

- You can create a further subdirectory 
for each problem statement and write your code solutions under this subdirectory. It is recommended if you want to submit your code solutions in multiple programming languages.

- If you do not want to create a subdirectory for each problem statement then your code solution file name must be the same as the problem statement.
