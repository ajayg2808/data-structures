## Branch creation guidelines

- Create a new branch for each solution. If small problems statements you can create a new branch for up to 5 solutions.

- Create a new branch with the following naming convention:
  > **[username]_[problem statement number]**

  Example:
  1. ajayg2808_001
  2. ajayg2808_002
