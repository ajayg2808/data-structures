## Problem Statements
- Go through the problem statements and solve them sequentially and submit (Pull request) them for review.
- Create a new branch to work on and commit your solution to your new branch. Once you have finished then create a new **pull request**. 
- It is advised to create a **pull request** for a single solution so that we can review it fast and accept your solution.
- Refer to [branch creation guidelines](./../branch_creation_guidelines.md).
